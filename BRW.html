    <h1>My Published Works</h1>
    <p>Under the pen name BR.Giga, I am an author of horror fiction, crafting spine-chilling tales that delve into the darker aspects of human nature and the supernatural. My stories blend vivid imagery, psychological tension, and suspense to captivate readers and leave a lasting impression.</p>
    <p>"The Smoking Specter of Manhood" is a horror short story by BR. Giga that follows a young boy's clandestine venture into his father's garage, where he discovers an old Led Zeppelin tape and a half-smoked cigar. As he indulges in the forbidden stogy, he unwittingly summons a sinister presence, leading to a chilling encounter that blurs the line between reality and the supernatural.</p>
    <p><b>Read The Smoking Specter of Manhood: <a href="https://www.short-story.me/stories/horror-stories/779-the-smoking-specter-of-manhood" target="_blank">The Smoking Specter of Manhood</a>.</b></p>
    <p>"The Fix" is a poem by BR Giga that vividly portrays the fleeting euphoria and subsequent descent into the abyss of addiction. Through concise and impactful language, it delves into the transient relief and ultimate annihilation brought on by substance abuse.</p>
